### Ng6junkyard - Angular playground

## Now Ng7junkyard (upgraded version)

* This project is a personal playground area, 
I'm trying to keep the structure modular and some of the modules / 
components I'm implementing / POC's here I actually reuse on other real life projects, 
* This project also being used as reference for blog posts I'm publishing ([my medium](https://medium.com/@lironhazan)).
* This project also being used to demonstrate some of the core concepts of an every day app development when developing 
with Angular and rxjs ( 6 + ).
